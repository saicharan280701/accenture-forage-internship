Introduction

During the internship, I had the opportunity to contribute as the data analyst on a new project for Social Buzz. Social Buzz is a media company which emphasizes its content rather than their users who remain anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user feeds. Over the past 5 years they have grow quicker than they expected and required and advisory firm to help oversee the scaling process. This is were we come in.
